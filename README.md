# Dogs React Application

Dogs is a React.JS project that has as its main target being a copy of a social media behaviour, such as Instagram, where you can identify how many people viewed your posts, comment in the in posts and upvote them.

# Technologies

The main technologies that I used in this project were:

* React
* JavaScript
* CSS (css.modules)
* Consuming API 


# Run on VSCode

For now you can see the current progress of the application until it's completely finished following the next steps.

First of all you should go to the project folder through the VSCode Terminal which is:

* **cd dogs**

To run it on VSCode you should install **serve** globally on your VSCode Terminal:
* **npm install -g serve**
(if you already have **serve** installed you can skip this step)
  
and lastly:
* **serve -s build**

and so you just press CTRL + Click on the **local** section created.
